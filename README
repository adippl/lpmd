	* basic configuration in constant variables (search for "config section"

>supported distros and machines?
	I created it for my thinkpad x270 running gentoo. It's mostly hardcoded for my
system. It should work on your system as long as paths to /sys filesystem looks
the same on your system. No guarantees.

>Is this a shell script?
yes it is
