lpmd is a minimal power management daemon for linux
main features
	* support for 2 batteries (BAT0 BAT1)
	* change of cpu governor on connect/disconnect of power adapter
	* setting of battery charging thresholds at the start
	* warnings when running low on battery power and not charging
	* suspending system when running low on battery power and not charging
	* basic configuration in const variables (search for "config section"
	* wall style message to all pseudo TTYs (not to /dev/tty*)
	* openrc initscript with logger started by start-stop-daemon
	* basic ebuild installing lpmd from git
	* <300 lines of code. You can (probably) easily understand it.

>supported distros and machines?
	I created it for my thinkpad x270 running gentoo. It's mostly hardcoded for my
system. It should work on your system as long as paths to /sys filesystem look
the same on your system. No guarantees.

>compilers?
testsed on gcc-9.3.0 and tcc 0.9.27
lpmd can be used with tcc -run option

>Is this a shell script?
Yes
